            <p>
                It is not uncommon for data to be used to misinform or mislead.  We'll explore some ways graphs can be used to misrepresent data and some ways to identify when that happens.

            <example>
                <statement>
                    <p>
                        The seasonally adjusted annual rate for new single-family houses sold in the United States (in thousands) between January 2020 and April 2020 is shown in the bar graph below.

                        The scale of the bars suggests that home sales dropped precipitously between Feb 20 and Apr 20, but in reality only dropped by about 100,000 homes between the two months.

                        What is different about this graph than the previous one?  In what ways might it be a better representation of the data?

                        The y-axis begins at 0, so we are able to compare the data from an intuitive baseline.  In doing so, we're able to see that while sales dropped between February 2020 and April 2020, the drop isn't as extreme as suggested by the first graph.
